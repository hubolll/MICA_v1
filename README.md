# MICA: A toolkit for Multimodal Image Coupling Analysis
In order to comprehensively reflect the functional states of the brain, 
we developed a software based on MATLAB 2014a platform to analyze the across-voxel coupling between multimodal images.
The software mainly included four functions. First, the data rename function could help remove the prefix of file name generated by preprocessing software, 
so as to facilitate the data preparation procedures. Second, the ROI extraction function could help extract ROIs from existed brain atlases. 
Third, through the function of coupling analysis, users can get across-voxel Pearson correlation coefficients 
between images of different modalities based on brain atlases or customed ROIs. Finally, the function of multiple comparison
correction could be used to correct the P-value in 2 false discovery rate (FDR) methods and a Bonferroni method, so as to reduce the false-positive rate.
